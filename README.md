### Day2 Pictogram Chart
In Pictogram Chart we use small icons to display the data. Each icon represents a certain category.

### Day 3:Historical Chart
Line Chart: Line charts connect individual numeric data points to visualize a sequence of values. Line charts are commonly used when a time element is present. The best use case for line charts involves displaying trends over a period of time.

Day 4: Magic/Magical chart
Radial Bar Chart: A Radial/Circular Bar chart is a bar chart that is plotted on a polar coordinate system, rather than on a Cartesian one.
There are also some pros and cons of the Radial Bar chart. Radial bar charts are so cool and primarily used for aesthetic reasons. In Radial bar charts the bar length can be misinterpreted, so Cartesian bar charts are always a better choice for comparing values.
