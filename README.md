### Day2 Pictogram Chart
In Pictogram Chart we use small icons to display the data. Each icon represents a certain category.

### Day 3:Historical Chart
Line Chart: Line charts connect individual numeric data points to visualize a sequence of values. Line charts are commonly used when a time element is present. The best use case for line charts involves displaying trends over a period of time.

Day 4: Magic/Magical chart
Radial Bar Chart: A Radial/Circular Bar chart is a bar chart that is plotted on a polar coordinate system, rather than on a Cartesian one.
There are also some pros and cons of the Radial Bar chart. Radial bar charts are so cool and primarily used for aesthetic reasons. In Radial bar charts the bar length can be misinterpreted, so Cartesian bar charts are always a better choice for comparing values.

### Day 5: Slope Chart
A slope chart is one of the most widely used simple charts. Slope charts are used when our analysis requires a comparison between two data points. Slope Charts is the most intuitive and easy-to-use platform for financial charting.

### Day 6: Experimental chart
For today’s challenge, I decided to go for a multiple-layered map with a pie chart. I used the superstore data set. The filled map represents the profit by State. I layered the map with a pie chart. The pie charts show the Sales by category.

### Day 7: Physical Chart
For today’s challenge, I choose the MLB player data set and analyzed the player’s height and weight.
I use a scatter plot and box plot to represent the data.

### Day 10: Path over time chart
These maps are called flow maps or path maps. Flow maps are great when we want to show where something went over time. For example path of a storm over a time period.
