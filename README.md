### Day2 Pictogram Chart
In Pictogram Chart we use small icons to display the data. Each icon represents a certain category.
![Pictogram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156491255-24ff360c-aa8f-49c5-91a8-e828f9c387fe.png)
### Day 3:Historical Chart
Line Chart: Line charts connect individual numeric data points to visualize a sequence of values. Line charts are commonly used when a time element is present. The best use case for line charts involves displaying trends over a period of time.
![Day3-Historical Data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156491369-4f349aba-2f5f-4cf2-8441-cba07660b075.png)
Day 4: Magic/Magical chart
Radial Bar Chart: A Radial/Circular Bar chart is a bar chart that is plotted on a polar coordinate system, rather than on a Cartesian one.
There are also some pros and cons of the Radial Bar chart. Radial bar charts are so cool and primarily used for aesthetic reasons. In Radial bar charts the bar length can be misinterpreted, so Cartesian bar charts are always a better choice for comparing values.
![RadialBarchart-day4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156491749-696a9bfe-33d0-42e2-adc5-5c0c1b60caa2.png)
### Day 5: Slope Chart
A slope chart is one of the most widely used simple charts. Slope charts are used when our analysis requires a comparison between two data points. Slope Charts is the most intuitive and easy-to-use platform for financial charting.
![SlopeChart-day5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156492067-66a2b3c2-01b1-44b0-9f4e-53da598c6a43.png)
### Day 6: Experimental chart
For today’s challenge, I decided to go for a multiple-layered map with a pie chart. I used the superstore data set. The filled map represents the profit by State. I layered the map with a pie chart. The pie charts show the Sales by category.
![Layermap-day6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156492251-50cabb5e-9dbd-4cb3-8821-cd8254bf1e5f.png)
### Day 7: Physical Chart
For today’s challenge, I choose the MLB player data set and analyzed the player’s height and weight.
I use a scatter plot and box plot to represent the data.
![MLB player height and Weight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156492355-0dda6ada-e0ab-48fe-a1b4-9596c1e821df.jpg)
### Day 8: Animal
![AnimalLifeExpectancy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156492459-b298c36f-1264-46d0-970f-c3f83b65de49.PNG)
### Day 9: Interactive Quadrants chart
![Interactive Quadrants chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156492544-95324143-ccd9-42a8-adaa-e0008298adbd.PNG)
### Day 10: Path over time chart
These maps are called flow maps or path maps. Flow maps are great when we want to show where something went over time. For example path of a storm over a time period.
![Abstract Chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156492685-346b2a7d-e425-41e7-ae2d-1e4958cfc67b.PNG)
### Day 11:Packed Bubble Chart:
A packed bubble chart is used to display data in a cluster of circles. Dimensions define the individual bubbles, and measures define the size and color of the individual circles.
![Car-sales data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156494981-a8ac2a6d-f459-44cd-bb67-3988e8a225c0.PNG)
### Day 12: Stripe Chart
For today’s chart, I tried to recreate Warming Stripes/Climate Stripe by climate scientist Ed Hawkins. Climate stripes visualize how temperatures have changed over the past century. Each vertical
stripe represents the average temperature in a year, with cooler temperatures shown in blue and warmer temperatures in red.
![WarmingStripes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156495055-55534009-ae60-46f2-89a8-20f1bd0a0eb6.PNG)
### Day 13: Correlation
The correlation matrix is great for visualizing similarities between items in your dataset. In Tableau, CORR() function is used to calculate Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
![CorrelationMatrix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156495151-785cfa5c-1256-4cab-b058-fa22bbb9737c.PNG)
### Day 14: Space
Space Missions from 1957-2020.
![Space Missions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156495244-7b69fad5-c706-4edf-acd9-c02e64b0a2a0.PNG)
### Day 15: Dot-matrix charts
Dot-matrix charts are useful for visualizing the distribution and frequency of discrete data. They help you understand the scale and proportion. The purchase is to understand how many, not how much.
![Multivariate Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156495391-c2b2f56d-3f97-4373-84c0-d910ab9d0565.PNG)
### Day 16: TreeMap
We use treemaps to display data in nested rectangles. Treemaps are a relatively simple data visualization that can provide insight in a visually attractive format. But when our data set consists of several categories and subcategories then we use Drill down treemap.
For this drill-down treemap, I have created a category set, Calculated field, and set actions on it.
![Drill Down Tree Map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156496720-6ed70b3f-058e-43b9-9d6f-0b99a7398fb7.PNG)
### Day 17: Pop Culture
List of awards and nominations received by Beyoncé.
![POP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156496781-3c92bbae-20b8-4657-a183-8ec67891ebef.png)
### Day 18: Destination map
I choose a destination map to show the connection. Destination Maps show paths between two points, origins, and destinations. Destination Maps are drawn from the point of origin and branch out their "flow lines."
![DestinationMaps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156496904-c61ec0fa-4702-4439-bd05-03e2e87cdfbe.PNG)
### Day 19: Global Change
After the Facebook outage, I decided to explore the Facebook users around the World.
India has the highest number of Facebook users in any country in the world, with over 251 million. The United States has the second-highest number of users, with about 240 million.
![FB user](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156496968-8a92b2ec-2bba-4ae3-93f6-bd61a8ed4207.PNG)
### Day 20: Upwards
Facebook: annual revenue and net income 2007-2020.
This chart presents Facebook's revenue and net income from 2007 to 2020. Facebook's revenue grew from 7.87 billion in 2013 to 86 billion US dollars in 2020.
![FacebookRevenue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156497009-48d3e900-8c33-40bf-bb18-b9cf34759fea.PNG)
### Day 21: Downwards
The COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 has resulted in widespread government travel restrictions, forcing airlines to run at reduced services. So the number of daily flights around the USA has decreased significantly. There is a 65% decline in air traffic volume in the year 2020(till Oct).
![Air Travel Decline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156497160-952320b6-2540-453a-a5b8-6e2472c052dc.PNG)
### Day 22: Animation
A motion chart helps us to visualize how the data is changing
over time. For this chart, I choose the Consumer Complain data set
![Motion Chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156497409-cc76b881-17a3-4053-8d18-f375c609c6f5.PNG)
### Day 23: Tiles chart
To show tiles in the chart I use a trellis chart. Trellis chart is of a group of similar charts having a common axis and value fields split across a category and a great choice when it comes to analyzing trends across a category in a single view. I choose the superstore data set for this visualization.
![Panel chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156497599-e6463b7e-4411-4daf-b72c-1949f1f786a4.PNG)
### Day 24: Monochrome
The monochrome palette is my favorite one because it is the easiest palette to choose. I spend maximum time finalizing the chart and dashboard color palette.
A monochrome chart does not mean that you have to use the same single shade in multiple places in your design. Instead, you can create a monochromatic color palette by choosing one base color plus any number of variations of that base. You can make variations by adding black, white, or gray to your base color.
●Shades: the base color darkened with black.
●Tones: the base color dulled (or desaturated) with gray.
●Tints: the base color lightened with white.
Monochrome color palette benefits:-
●It creates a harmonious, visually cohesive look.
●It doesn’t draw attention to itself but lets your content shine.
For this chart, I choose Superstore data sets and I compare the average with a bar chart.
![Monochrome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156497677-9f3ad213-2a45-41a2-8340-88310b6213db.PNG)
Day 25: Butterfly chart
I choose a butterfly chart to show population projection in British Columbia. This is also called a Tornado chart. In this chart, I displayed Male and Female populations side by side. So that we can get a glance of the difference between two groups with the same parameter.
![Butterfly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156497761-9e439257-1714-4e4d-a9ef-a35e61283c72.PNG)
### Day 26: Trend Chart
The trend chart shows how the number of Social Media users increased from 2010 to 2021.
![Trend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156498302-7f78c19d-8ad4-4112-8abd-e3275f029629.PNG)
### Day 27: Side By Side Bar Chart
How did students perform in fall 2020 relative to a typical school year (specifically, fall 2019)? To answer these questions, I compared students’ academic achievement and growth during the COVID-19 pandemic to the achievement and growth patterns observed in 2019. The figure below shows the median percentile rank in math by grade level in fall 2019 and fall 2020. As the figure indicates, the math achievement of students in 2020 was about 5 to 10 percentile points lower compared to same-grade students the prior year.
![Sidebyside bar chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156498380-be399dd6-7a8d-4713-8394-4c1fcc94ed2f.PNG)
### Day28: Forcast
The rise and fall of house prices can have big implications for the economy. Recently Home prices in Dallas have increased significantly in recent months. The below chart forecast the Dallas Home price index. (The House Price Index (HPI) is a broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices in the United States.)
![Forecast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156498502-78d87b28-1e79-4576-a4dd-86ae4535c3ca.PNG)
### Day 29:Control Chart
The control chart is a graph used to study how a process changes over time. Data are plotted in time order. A control chart always has a central line for the average, an upper line for the upper control limit, and a lower line for the lower control limit. These lines are determined from historical data. By comparing current data to these lines, you can draw conclusions about whether the process variation is consistent (in control) or is unpredictable (out of control, affected by special causes of variation). 
I use the superstore data set to visualize the control chart. I use the parameter so that the user can control the upper and lower limits. In this chart, I am showing which month sales are outside of one standard deviation.
![Control chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73730336/156499983-ab2ddef0-b53e-4773-932d-9b88809cff2e.PNG)
### Day 30:3D Bar chart
